             <p class="aboutMeFontColor">My name is Ernesto J. Rodriguez. Some of my hobbies include playing video games,
                reading comics and manga, and tinkering with tech.
                I hold a B.S. in Information Technology, and I'm currently working on earning my CompTIA A+ certification.
                I'm a self-taught web developer, continually learning more about both front-end and back-end
                development.<br><br>


                Every day is an opportunity to better yourself—and with that mindset, I plan to make my mark in the dev space
                one day!<br><br>


                Lately, I've been really into '90s anime, and I've caught the bug for PSX games—especially anything touched by
                Yasumi Matsuno.
                He's a Japanese video game designer known for his work on Final Fantasy Tactics (which could be argued its his
                magnum opus),
                Tactics Ogre, and most recently, I've been hooked on Vagrant Story.
